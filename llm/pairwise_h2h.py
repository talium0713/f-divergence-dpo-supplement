"""pairwise_h2h.py — direct head-to-head between two of our Arena-Hard v0.1 answer sets, reusing arena-hard's
EXACT judge (OG_ARENA_HARD_PROMPT system prompt + prompt_template + [[A>>B]] regex + gpt-4.1-2025-04-14,
temp 0). Two games per prompt with position swap (A/B), then A's win rate vs B = (wins + 0.5*ties)/games,
with a prompt-level bootstrap CI. Does NOT touch the arena repo.

    python pairwise_h2h.py --a kl_bdpo --b rkl_bdpo --out logs/h2h_rkl_fkl.json

Writes the summary to --out and the per-prompt outcomes + the 1000 bootstrap replicates to
<out>_raw.json, so quartiles/other CI levels can be recomputed without paying for the judge again.
